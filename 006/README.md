# Batman-API

<img src = "https://github.com/SrijanReddy/Random/blob/master/006/bat.jpg?raw=true" width = 60 height=100> 

I tried to create a web API using Flask and Python. Web APIs are tools for making information and application functionality accessible over the internet. A web API allows for information or functionality to be manipulated by other programs via the internet. This API consists of quotes from Dark Knight Trilogy

source for quotes-[link](https://inspirationfeed.com/batman-quotes/)

First I saved those quotes in a text file and seperated them as quote, id, quotee and saved them into a json using python. After that i converted that json into database using sqlite then I loaded that sqlite file into flask application.
 
 *To run this API-* <br>
 - Download the repo <br>
 - `pip install-r requirements.txt` <br>
 - `python api-v1.py` <br>
 - access the api using id,quotee<br>
 
 > ps. dont access using even id number
