# Rock Paper Scissor Simulation

### Nash Equilibrium
In a two player game (A,B) ∈ R^(m×n)^2, (σr,σc) is a Nash equilibrium if σr is a best response to σc and vice versa.

Game theory suggests that a purely rational game would involve players guessing infinitely far ahead of their opponents moves, this is why the Nash Equilibrium of RPS is playing randomly. Rock paper scissor is an example to this. Rock, Paper or Scissors with equal probability, denoted as (1/3,1/3,1/3). This means Rock, Paper and Scissors are each chosen with probability 1/3. Our program also demonstrates this probability if more sample space is provided i.e higher number of simulations closer the actual probability. Our program runs simulation on number of games and displays number of wins and win percentage

In order to get better picture of our game, we’ll construct a table that shows the probability of each of the nine possible outcomes every round: Rock for A, Rock for B; Rock for A, Paper for B; and so on. In the chart below, the top row indicates Player B’s choice, and the leftmost column indicates Player A’s choice.

> The fact that all such games have such equilibria is an important concept in game theory.
